# Unicorn-UI-Kit
Full Stack Unicorns' UI Kit. No suck here.

### Goals
- Use cases first, no more copying unreliable CSS snippets to add features.
- Not reimplementing things already done well (Slick, Owl, etc.)
- Fully featured UI kit
- Designed for the modern web, (IE10/11, recent versions of Webkit/Gecko)
